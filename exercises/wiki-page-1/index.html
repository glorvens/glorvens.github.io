            <i>  canopy disengagement</i>, <sup>I </sup> <i>canopy shyness,[I] 
            or inter-crown spacing(3]) 
            is a phenomenon observed in some 
            tree species,species, in which the crowns 
            of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, forming a canopy with 
            channel-like gaps. [4]LS] The phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of the
            same species,but also occurs between trees of different species. (67) 
            There exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, 
            and research suggests that it
            might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.

            The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is not certain.<suv> 6</suv> 
            The phenomenon has been discussed in scientific literature since 
            the 1920s. <suv>[9]</suv> The variety of hypotheses and experimental results 
            might suggest that there are multiple mechanisms across different 
            species, an example of convergent evolution. [citation needed]

            Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy branches 
            leads to "reciprocal pruning" of adjacent trees. Trees in windy 
            areas suffer physical damage as they collide with each other during
            winds. As the result of abrasions and collisions, there is an 
            induced crown shyness response. Studies suggest that lateral branch
            growth is largely uninfluenced by neighbours until disturbed by 
            mechanical abrasion. <suv>[101]</suv> If the crowns are artificially prevented
            from colliding in the winds, they gradually fill the canopy gaps.
            | This explains instances of crown shyness between branches of 
            the same organism. Proponents of this idea cite that shyness is
            particularly seen in conditions conducive to this pruning, 
            including windy forests, stands of flexible trees, and early 
            succession forests where branches are flexible and limited in 
            lateral movement. <suv>[61[12]</suv> By this explanation, variable 
            flexibility in lateral branches has a large bearing on degree 
            of crown shyness.
