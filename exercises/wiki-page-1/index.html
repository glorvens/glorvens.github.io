    <h1>Crown shyness</h1>
    
 
   canopy disengagement, I canopy shyness,[I] or inter-crown spacing(3]) 
is a phenomenon observed in some tree species,species, in which the crowns 
of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, forming a canopy with 
channel-like gaps. [4]LS] The phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of the
 same species,but also occurs between trees of different species. (67) 
 There exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, 
 and research suggests that it
 might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae. &]
