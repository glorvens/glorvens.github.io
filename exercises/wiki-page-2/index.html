                Design is a profession, J academic discipline (3](4](E] and 
                applied art whose activity consists in projecting visual
                communications intended to transmit specific messages to 
                social groups, with specific objectives. [& Graphic design is 
                an interdisciplinary branch of design I and of the fine arts. 
                Its practice involves
                creativity, innovation and lateral thinking using manual or digital
                tools, where it is usual to use text and graphics to communicate
                visually.

             The role of the graphic designer in the communication process 
             is that of encoder or interpreter of the message. They work on 
             the interpretation, ordering, and presentation of visual messages.
              Usually, graphic design uses the aesthetics of typography and the
               compositional arrangement of the text, ornamentation, and 
               imagery to convey ideas, feelings, and attitudes beyond what 
               language alone expresses. The design work can be based on a 
               customer's demand, a demand that ends up being established 
               linguistically, either orally or in writing, that is, that 
               graphic design transforms a linguistic message into a graphic 
               manifestation.[7

             Graphic design has, as a field of application, different areas 
             of knowledge focused on any visual communication system. 
             For example, it can be applied in advertising strategies, 
             or it can also be applied in the aviation world[8] or space 
             exploration.[9][10] In this sense, in some countries graphic 
             design is related as only associated with the production of 
             sketches and drawings, this is incorrect, since visual 
             communication is a small part of a huge range of types 
             and classes where it can be applied.
