                    Billy is a sweet baby that adores her people and plays very well
                    with her in home dog friends. She is not a fan of cats. She 
                    is about 30lbs and 2 years old.Hanna is house broken and crate 
                    trained. She even goes in her crate on her own and takes naps.

                <p>
                    She takes a few minutes to scope out a new environment but warms 
                    when she feels comfortable. Hanna is learning what a treat is and 
                    loving them. She has medium to high energy so she wants an active.
